 * CPP IEEE Winter 2018 Quarterly Project
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * Replicate Conway's Game of Life on an Arduino
 * with a 32x32 LED display. Control the generation
 * cycle speed, to manually set up the board, to
 * randomly generate a new board once the board's
 * state stops changing for an amount of time, and
 * to control LED brightness.
 * 
 * These goals may change throughout the course
 * of the project depending on how other teams
 * in the project are doing.
